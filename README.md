# Movie_Trailer_Website
A Project Developed Using Python Data Structures

# Requirements
1) The user needs to Install Python IDE (ver 2.7 suggested)
2) Familiar with basic Python Programming and Data Structures

# Usage
Download / Clone this repository to your desktop. 

Make sure that all the files will be saved in **same location** 

Open the files in Python IDE and run the module `Entertainment_center.py`

# Quick Notes
Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer in a movie class called `media.py`

Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.

Use the `fresh_tomatos.py` to ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.

The file `fresh_tomatos.py` contains the `open_movies_page()` function that will take in your list of movies and generate an HTML file including this content, producing a website to showcase your favorite movies.
